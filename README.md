# OwnScalaProject_ROVER
Simple OOP project using Scala3. 

__Starting date:__ 24.01.2023

__Usage:__ Just to try out some OOP in Scala

__Plan:__

* implement abstract class Rover, sub classes that inherit can be either stationary or moving rovers
* use traits to offer specific behaviour(collecting items in general, one trait especially for chemistry/analysis collecting material)
* use enums -> for kinds of materials
* Use funtional programming when possible
