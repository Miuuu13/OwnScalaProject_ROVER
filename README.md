# OwnScalaProject_ROVER
Simple OOP project using Scala3. 
Plan: 
-implement abstract class Rover, sub classes that inherit can be either stationary or moving rovers
-use traits to offer specific behaviour(collecting items in general, one trait especially for chemistry/analysis collecting material)
-use enums -> for kinds of materials
-Use funtional programming when possible
